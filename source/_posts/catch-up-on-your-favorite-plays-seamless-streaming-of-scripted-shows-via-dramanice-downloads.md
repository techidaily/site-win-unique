## Catch Up on Your Favorite Plays: Seamless Streaming of Scripted Shows via Dramanice Downloads

### Overview

Want to download Dramanice raw drama videos or drama videos with subtitles to MP4, FLV, WMV, MOV, MKV, AVI, etc? This article is just sharing two commonly used methods to download Dramanice drama videos.

### Method 1: Use Dramanice to download Dramanice raw drama videos

Find the Dramanice video that you like to download and go to its video playing interface. At bottom right of the video playing window you will find the 'Download ' button, click the 'Download ' button and then you will be directed to another downloading page in which choose the video with your wanted video resolution and then click your chosen link to finish your video downloading work.

**This method seems easy but the only inconvenience is that this method can only download your wanted video to the designated video format, usually MP4 format. If your device can not play MP4 well you need another video converter to convert the downloaded MP4 to other video formats. Want to directly download Dramanice videos to not only MP4, but also AVI, FLV, WMV, MOV, MKV or any other wanted video formats? If so, check the following Method 2.**
